# Linear Algebra Training thingie
A website to create exercises to learn things like the crossprodukt or dotprodukt. Probaply all that will ever be on there are simple things. No fancy ones.

The currently implemented exercises are:
 - the skalarprodukt.
 - the crossproduct.

The whole thing is currently hosted [https://ln.topdf.de/Linear_Algebra/](here). Feel free to use it as you wish but please credit me if possible

Have fun :)
